## Machine Learning Mastery: Regression Analysis Suite 📊🚀
This repository contains a collection of end-to-end Machine Learning projects focusing on Regression Analysis. From foundational simple linear models to complex multi-variate and non-linear polynomial transformations, this suite demonstrates the application of "Precise and General Thinking" in predictive modeling.

# Overview
### 1. Practical Simple Linear RegressionGoal: 
Predicting height based on weight using the classic $y = mx + c$ formula.
### Key Techniques: 
Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), correlation analysis with df.corr(), and robust feature scaling using StandardScaler to prevent model bias.
### File: 
Practical Simple Linear Regression.ipynb.

# Multiple Linear Regression: 
Economic Indicator Analysis
### Goal: 
Predicting stock index prices by analyzing the combined impact of Interest Rates and Unemployment Rates.

### Key Techniques: 
Multi-dimensional logic (Hyperplanes), handling multi-variate inputs, and building a prediction pipeline for real-time inference.

### File: 
Multiple_Linear_Regression.ipynb.

# Polynomial Regression: 
Modeling Non-Linearity
### Goal: 
Demonstrating how to model complex, curved relationships that a standard straight line cannot capture.

### Key Techniques: 
Transforming linear features into polynomial features to capture higher-order patterns in data.

# 4. Attendance vs. Score Prediction
### Goal: 
A practical educational dataset analysis predicting student performance based on study hours and attendance.

### Key Techniques: 
Visualization of the "Best Fit Line" using Seaborn and Matplotlib to confirm the linear trend.
